								exercising these privacy rights. We describe the
								choices you have to manage your privacy and data
								across MinuteZero's services and to access,

								authorized agent) can also contact MinuteZero.
								And if you disagree with the decision on your
								request, you can ask MinuteZero to reconsider
								it.
